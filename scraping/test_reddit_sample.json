{"Manchester City's potential punishment/let off": {"description": "This is a genuine question, due to seeing lots of comments regarding any potential punishment.\n\nAs we're all aware, Manchester City have been charged 115 times by the Premier League for various rule breaking, some are financial breaches and others are much smaller things. \n\nOne thing I'm seeing a lot of, all over social media, is that people believe they won't get any form of punishment at all. Obviously most of those comments come from City fans, so it could be a case of wishful thinking more than anything! But I've also seen fans of other clubs saying they think that nothing will happen, some feel like this because they think that money will exchange between the right hands and some feel that City have now become a big club, so they won't punish them as those players potentially leaving the Premier League will be detrimental. Some fans think they are innocent, but seem to often forget that they were charged a couple years ago and fined 30m, banned from Europe and had a transfer ban imposed on them. They only got out of that due to a loophole involving timeline, which CAS used. That same loophole doesn't exists in the Premier League. Also some of the evidence was ropey, but that was because City weren't cooperating with the investigation, which kinda says they are hiding something. I'm also seeing comments that people believe they'll change sponsorship rules after this is dealt with, to allow it in the future. \n\nMy personal opinion on the matter, is that it's almost impossible not to hand out a massive punishment.  115 charges is a huge amount of potential rule breaking. Even if they are guilty of only 20% of them, that's still 23 charges! If there's a fair bit of financial rule breaking in there, it could be said that even what they have right now, was built off the back of cheating. If they were to get away with it, other cash rich clubs would follow suit, and football would be worse off for it. The only thing that makes me think that they might get a light punishment is the threat of a breakaway League. If the Premier League kick them out, they could then join Barcelona and Real Madrid start attempting to start a \"European Super League\". Other big/rich clubs will follow eventually if that's where the money is. \n\nWhat do other people think on the matter and why? What do you think the punishment will be? Also it would be good to see which club you support to see if there's a certain opinion from certain supporters.", "comments": ["Fellow fans, this is a friendly reminder to please follow the [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/premierleague/about/rules) and [Reddiquette](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette). \n\nPlease also make sure to [Join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/football)\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There is no going back now for the Premier League. They have a done a thorough investigation spanning years of researching into years of potential crime from Man City.\n\nThe reason I believe there is no going back, is because the Premier League has punished Everton and for fewer charges and are intending to punish Everton again along with Nottingham Forest.\n\nYou cannot just punish some clubs and not others, especially not when one is accused of 115 breaches of the rules. There are potential legal battles involved in this, if Everton and Forest are punished and Man City walks out unpunished for what appears to be far worse crimes.\n\nNow I get that it takes time for the City case to reach a verdict due to its vastness and all the years it spans and it includes thousands of documents, so it will take time to reach a verdict, but they can't just give City a slap on the wrist neither, not aften what they have done to Everton. It would not make sense, especially also because Everton cooperated in the investigation whereas Man City has refused to do such.\n\nThere will be an uproar amongst fans and clubs, especially clubs like Everton and Nottingham Forest, if City are getting a slap on the wrist while others get points deducted.\n\nThe question is more likely when we will see punishment than if we will, but there has to be something about it or else the Premier League would not accuse Man City. They have to believe they have a case, cause they are the accusers and it's their own jurisdisctional system, so they must believe City have done something corruptional of the rules.\n\nA couple of weeks ago Ceferin of UEFA spoke that he is sure they were right and they were right to accuse Man City, regardless of what happened in CAS. I believe Premier League is working on the same terms, they believe they have sufficient evidence to charge Man City or else they wouldn't charge.\n\nSo to put it short: I do believe City will be punished. I don't think there is any way in which the Premier League can save any face or avoid any kind of uproar if they do not punish City with a significant punishment such as relegation, strip of titles or points deductions.", "They\u2019re guilty and the PL is going to punish Luton for it.", "Not a case of 'if' but when.

This means the other 19 clubs in the Premier League have charged them. This is not the FA, this is not UEFA who didn\u2019t win against them because City used their own rules against them to time bar.\n\nCity have also not been able to pick 2 of the 3 judges who decide the verdict in this, unlike CAS.\n\nIf the PL wanted to ignore this to avoid \u201ctainting the product\u201d, they wouldn\u2019t have publically charged them. They believe that City have tainted the product and have investigated them, and find them guilty of 115 charges.\n\nThe moment that Everton were punished 10 points for going over their allowed financial losses by about \u00a320m, set a precedent. This was a punishment for a team that showed their books, held their hands up and accepted punishment.\n\nCity have not shown books, City have vehemently denied any wrongdoing and continuously been as uncooperative as possible. The reason for the delay is 100% on City dragging it out, winning more in the interim and pressing other channels (such as putting pressure on the U.K. government) .\n\nAgain, Everton co-operated and got a 10 pts punishment (reduced to 6) based on \u00a320m over the allowed amount.\n\nThat\u2019s 1 charge.\n\nCity face charges over 8 years of not providing accurate financials.\n\nThere\u2019s a few years of breaking the PL FFP rules. 2015-2018.\n\nInaccurate information regarding player and staff payments (under the table deals, off the books etc) from 2010-2018.\n\nBreaking of the UEFA FFP rules (the same ones that UEFA tried to have them punished with).\n\nHonestly, I think City fans have a right to be worried. I believe that the entire book is going to be thrown at them. Too many eyes on this and it\u2019s just so much a public interest case.\n\nNo doubt, I\u2019m going to get City fans responding asking me to provide evidence and all that, but honestly, it\u2019s like trying to convince a theist there is no god.

I stated how I feel in the original post. I can't help but feel that City are in genuine trouble with these charges as too much seems to be against them. So if someone says something along those lines, then I'm likely to agree with them. \n\nI believe that City fans are at a stage of wishful thinking or denial when they say they are innocent. Even those that believe some dodgy dealings have happened, seem to believe they'll get a slap on the wrist. I'm more than happy to read opposing views on the matter and why they believe certain outcomes are likely, it's the whole reason I did the post. \n\nAnd this is for a sensible discussion, I'm not after football tribalism.

When Liverpool were spending it was entirely fair game for others to do so, and yet, no one else came in and looked to go up against *financially doped* Merseyside. For some reason there also seems to be an assumption that everyone in the PL will just miraculously find a philanthropic billionaire, and they\u2019ll suddenly compete if FFP is lifted. \n\nIt just won\u2019t happen. The \u201cBig 3\u201d have remained as part of the status quo even despite several new, richer, challengers along the way. Blackburn fell away, Leeds fell away, Newcastle fell away. Chelsea could still fall away. For every successful City story there\u2019s probably 10+ failures, and clubs being put in to turmoil because of it. Do we really want that?\n\nThe likes of Everton, Villa and Spurs could have probably broken back in to the Top 4 picture more consistently if the likes of Chelsea and City didn\u2019t break the market. Arsenal and Liverpool both dropped a level in the 00s, so the opportunity would have been there. But, that opportunity was taken away by teams wanting to jump the queue with unlimited spending. In Chelsea\u2019s case it wasn\u2019t even necessary they were already rich and semi-decent. \n\nEven if we take the assumption that all 20 clubs in the PL got free-spending wealthy owners, all we then do is move the gap between 6 and 7th to 20th and the 1st in the championship. Surely the gap between the PL and EFL would grow even wider, and that seems like a bigger problem at this moment in time. The \u201cBig 6\u201d aren\u2019t untouchable, but we definitely don\u2019t want the PL as a whole to become untouchable.", "These days, financial doping will kill a club. If you tell one of these billionaire owners to spend whatever they want, they will be buying up all the top players for huge sums of money and wages. Then what happens if the owner suddenly loses interest or stops funding the club? The club could end up bankrupt. These clubs are businesses and are loved by millions of people around the world. They aren't some toy for a billionaire to play with. \n\nPersonally I think a new owner should be able to invest some personal wealth into a club. But not enough to screw the club over if they ever leave.", "It's all dependent on lots of things isn't it? In England our clubs get some decent money from TV deals. Unlike the other big leagues where certain clubs get larger amounts. I'm not against some outside investment, but not to the point where they've bought an entire team and whacked them all on obscene wages. \n\nI would love to see all leagues apply caps. All clubs can spend say 100m per year on transfers, this can be saved up to spend more a following year etc. This will encourage youngster growth as they are free. Wages are capped etc. Players will start playing for the badge again. The clubs that make decent money can invest that into the stadium, training grounds and youth. Football has lost its soul and it's because of the silly money that's infested it.", "Well, if we're doing it by the book they should be docked 20 points for every season since then.

The Financial Fair Play rules were put into place many years aften Moore was part of Liverpool and to say Liverpool used financial doping on the transfer market is moronic. Look at what they bought Keegan for and how much they sold him for to purchase Hansen and Dalglish. That isn't exactly using financial doping, that is being smart on scouting just as Shankly was revolutionary on managing. \n\nYou need evidence of your claim that Liverpool cheated or else, you're the spade. \n\nStop ruining these debates with your takes that has no relevance.", "I think they did benefit.

Why play fair when the opposition wasn\u2019t from the beginning. \n\nJust for the record as a city fan from long before the takeover I don\u2019t deny the possibility we broke some financial rules along the way and will accept that verdict if it comes. However I also can\u2019t deny that there is no realistic way for a team that isn\u2019t already in the established elite to challenge for titles and break into the  top 5 for any length of time with the current financial rules. Which just makes football as boring as people say it is now with city winning titles. I\u2019m thankful we didn\u2019t have another decade of Man U/Liverpool or Arsenal winning all the titles. The money problem was already endemic in top flight football, people are mainly just pissed that someone else broke into it. \n\nThe only thing that really grinds my gears is everyone treating it like a forgone conclusion when it clearly isn\u2019t yet. It just means that even if we are cleared for insufficient evidence and this was all a witch hunt, no one will change their minds anyway.

Should that be allowed? \n\nIf so what happens if the bank also goes bust and has to be rescued by the state, effectively leaving the club in state ownership and the viability of said club open to political favour. \n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a recent case study of this  occurring but can\u2019t remember which club it involved. \n\nOh yes, that would be Liverpool FC in the aftermath of the Hicks / Gillette omni shambles. \n\nShould we not also apply retrospective punishment on Liverpool FC for this unfair state subsidy? In addition to their historic financial doping dating back to the 60s of course\u2026", "I think we can all agree on that. \n\nBut any assessment can\u2019t be limited to a very recent window - to do so would smack of hypocrisy if we are wilfully blind of past abuses by others.

It has to be self-sustaining.\n\nThe rules were implemented on the crusp of clubs trying to do a \"Chelsea\" in which you see fast succes upon a financial advantage, however unlike Chelsea many clubs that tried, did not succeed.\n\nClubs like QPR, Leeds, Portsmouth, Coventry, Rangers, Parma, Fiorentina, Palermo, Mallorca, Malaga etc. tried but shortly after could not uphold the wage bills etc and fell into enourmous debt and some even into liquidation. Some clubs has fought to get back, some clubs never came back.\n\nTo prevent such from happening again and further on in such magnitude and also to try to level the playing field so clubs didn't have to go into debt to try to compete, the Financial Fair Play rules were put into action. With immediate effect.\n\nSince then, the rules, although flawed, has seen many clubs avoid liquidation (AC Milan, Valencia, Roma etc.) and have furthermore helped grass root football, due to the fact that money from the fines given to rule breaching clubs are distributed down in the lower systems and into grass root football.\n\nCan I ask you, did you read up on FFP at all before you came to the conclusion that it was implemented to solely stop Man City?", "Huh?

Davies took advantage of the FA's dodgy dealings when they expelled numerous City players from playing for City and signed City's stars. Later that decade United won the League twice and the FA Cup. SUCCESS, BOUGHT!\n\nThen they went on the current Manchester record without winning a trophy - 37 years. They were failing as a club again. Their football was shite and they were pulling in average season attendances of 11000 at the Theatre of Drips. Low and behold, just as United were about to go bankrupt, another sugar Daddy came along to save their bacon. James W. Gibson pumped a load of money into that football club, who just previously couldn't even afford to buy their own kits and were given hand-outs of old kits by City (hence the term Rags!), from nowhere. Over the next decade they won promotion, had three League runner-up finishes and won the FA Cup. SUCCESS BOUGHT!

After 10 years of fighting the inevitable moneybags at Manchester United, we won the trophy with a team that cost less than Rio Ferdinand. We made our way to the Champions League final in 2004. We used our success and financial prudence to build our own state of the art stadium. The moment we had to be even more prudent, was the moment Chelsea came in and threw \u00a3200m at players. Which was twice as much as United and Arsenal put together were spending. Then City did the same and here we are, teams that did not build any success, but simply bought it. And the kicker? These two teams who were outspending the rest of the league with insane amounts to fast track their way to the top, already playing in a different financial game to traditional clubs, were also going above and beyond the rules and cheating the rest of the league.\n\nYou\u2019re right, it\u2019s a very hard gap to do it under FFP rules for teams even if they had unlimited wealth.

Why dont they get nearly as bad name as City fans? Ever wonder? \n\nDifference is these guys are atleast getting into football for the passion of the sport and has the skin to be called a gloryhunter. Another difference is they are also not condoning massive human rights abuses (but tbh lets face it, that shits everywhere. But atleast your club embraces it on a face level. So why don't the fans too? Why do the fans all act 'ohh look at me innocent city fan hihi'?? Just act your role bro, which is the product of bastardization of football. \n\nEven now. Even now after I said you are still trying to make up argument about how I am actually just wrong. Its fine man. I get it. \n\nAnd no. Im not like in denial that City are powerhouse atm or anything. They literally are and will be for some time. So kudos. But dont be acting like that success wasnt outright bought, just like anything else in this disgusting capitalistic society. Thats my gripe.

But what im saying is embrace it. Stop acting like something you are not, a seasoned football fan who has seen their club go through thick and thin. Thats all.\n\nAnd at the end of the day if you really think 99% of the footballing world is wrong about City and that City is 100% innocent, hardworking and passionate institution with loyal and non-bastardized fans then like, good for you?

One is an unestablished team breaking the mould. The other is the status quo that's even less competitive.\n\n>And now, you\u2019ve pulled so far out in front, that nobody can ever compete with City, this is now fair and you are fighting the good fight, or something? \n\nNo one can compete? 1 or 2 points to win doesn't sound so far in front. That's happened 2x out of our last 5 wins. And last season where we won by 5 was in your own hands mate. This season is even more competitive. Liverpools 1 win is tied with our second biggest margin.

Unfortunately, it may also be because of expectations as clubs of old. Look at any side that nearly won the league from 92-2010. Outside of Blackburn (who spent quite a bit back then) and Chelsea (who spent quite a bit) it took Arsene Wenger to stop Man U on several occasions.\nIs it not a pity that man u could flex their wealth and basically stranglehold the prem title?

Give me a break brother.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily call it \"jealousy\", and even if I did, thats not the only reason, but it definitely is a big reason. I never said that people were jealous of Man City so idk why your basing your argument on solely that. \n\nAlso the reason why those clubs are on the pedestal of respect is because they achieved consistent success many many years ago (obviously). Any new club that comes around and enjoys consistent success is not going to be accepted at first due to how football culture works. And in modern football, consistent success is literally **impossible** without money or and ownership take over. Look at how Chelsea was treated in the early 2000s.\n\nBtw, what team do you support?\n\n>additionally I can just as well flip your question. You like and support City because they started winning. Literally thats the only reason. Then atleast you be a man enough yourself to admit that.\n\nI didnt start supporting City because they started winning. But it doesn't matter what I say, because youll never believe it. In your head you cope with the fact that weve enjoyed success because you want to believe that City dont have any real fans. \n\nThis is what I mean by you have a \"negative agenda\" and no matter how much blatant evidence you (and other people) get against it, you will never accept that youre wrong, lol.

With financial prudence, tactical nous, smart recruitment, clever sales, you know, the same things that catapulted teams like United, Liverpool and Arsenal to the very top.\n\nNow what is realistic for them?\n\nCity and Chelsea have turned the entire league on its head. Both teams out spend the others with third party wealth, they create super teams with 2 ridiculous players in each position, pushing the natural order out of sync with an unnatural money cheat code. \n\nDo you think City has made it easier for teams like Palace, West Ham, Wolves, Brighton etc?\n\nIf anything, it\u2019s made it 10x harder for these teams to survive. Before, a team like Brighton, a well managed club could make smart decisions, make great profits from unearthing players and selling them to the higher clubs. Or at the very least, hold on to those players for longer.\n\nDo you think if Chelsea wasn\u2019t able to spend the entire PL\u2019s transfer budget in one season, doesn\u2019t have a knock on effect of these teams?\n\nArsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham and United will survive, because they are established. They have an historic fanbase that has organically grown over decades. They have built a stable structure from which to operate. The only thing that Chelsea and City have done that affects these clubs is overinflate player costs and added more competition for trophies.\n\nThe league is getting harder and harder, the gulf in quality between the PL sides and newly promoted sides has only gotten bigger.\n\nYou have not helped their cause. You have helped strangle it.\n\nYou say that it\u2019s unfair that teams who worked ridiculously hard, competed on small amounts, who built success on top of success, after years of excelling, had an advantage over teams like City. \n\nDo you believe that the winner should not be rewarded on finishing first? Because that is what you are arguing against.\n\nYou arguing that these teams, who spent years winning the league, growing themselves on years of hard work and successfully running their clubs, got an unfair advantage by winning things.\n\nThat was always the motivation, along with the trophies, to increase their reputation. Which meant more money, so that they could build a better team.\n\nCity and Chelsea did not do this organically.\n\nThe crux is, you were jealous of other teams around you winning everything. You won the lottery by a billionaire buying your club and its soul, to turn their name that stinks of corruption, slavery and human rights abuses into a nice, clean, \u201cgood Samaritan\u201d who have done wonders.\n\nAnd now that you have a taste of winning things that were normally reserved for teams that built their success over years and years, you want to cling on to your success and trot out stuff like \u201cwe earned it\u201d or \u201cthe rules were unfair to begin with\u201d, despite making the rules 10x more unfair than they used to be, but not giving a toss because it\u2019s you who won the lottery.\n\nYou don\u2019t care about other teams.

The older clubs have money because they have reaped the benefits of performing at the top level for a decade or two\n\nYes, that is fair. And I wouldn't complain if every other club in the league could spend like that. Unlike other fans.\n\n\n>So explain to me, how is it fair for every other established club has not had a lottery jackpot that City got?\n\nI believe they *ahem* don't need it? That's kinda the privileged position those clubs are in. Why do they need \"new\" billionaire owners than the ones they have and spend as much as city anyway?\n\n\n>the same things that catapulted teams like United, Liverpool and Arsenal to the very top.\n\nThat is not what catapulted those teams to the top. Liverpool was invested in heavily early on compared to other football clubs. Man Utd were definitely tactically sound, sold players fairly well and recruited pretty good too, but they've never been prudent financially (that's laughable). Arsenal are probably the most inspirational club in the league through their history. But their success on the prem still puts them a distaaaaaaaant second (if you exclude city and chelsea) so they are the closest thing that an established club could do to the status quo. That doesn't sound competitive. They couldn't spend as much as Man u and that doesn't sound fair either.\n\nI believe before Man city started winning consistently it wasn't unpopular to throw shade at United for being big ol moneybags and how unfair that was. Everyone needs someone to blame I see.\n\n>they create super teams with 2 ridiculous players in each position, pushing the natural order out of sync with an unnatural money cheat code. \n\nMmmm yes Chelsea has a squad of complete ridiculousness of course \ud83d\ude05 and I believe most people don't consider Grealish, Nunes, Ake, Ortega, Kovacic and Akanji as ridiculous players (especially if pep wasn't there).\n\n>Before, a team like Brighton, a well managed club could make smart decisions, make great profits from unearthing players and selling them to the higher clubs. Or at the very least, hold on to those players for longer.\n\nName 1 player Man City has bought from Brighton \ud83e\udd14 and you're acting like Brighton don't do that. They've been that. They've bled Chelsea dry and made serious bank. How is that bad?\n\n>The league is getting harder and harder, the gulf in quality between the PL sides and newly promoted sides has only gotten bigger.\n\nHas it though? I'm fairly sure clubs in the decade are equally as likely to go down as the previous 2x decades \ud83e\udd14\n\n\n>You say that it\u2019s unfair that teams who worked ridiculously hard, competed on small amounts, who built success on top of success, after years of excelling, had an advantage over teams like City. \n\nCompeted on small amounts \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d bruh, Liverpool broke the transfer record on Andy Carroll right after City broke it with Robinho. Man Utd broke transger record after transfer record. Again, Arsenal are the only team I cant hold to that candle, but they werent being stingy before 2004. Don't pretend they had to spend more money to catch up to a team that hadn't done anything yet.\n\n>Do you believe that the winner should not be rewarded on finishing first? Because that is what you are arguing against.\n\nI believe they should be rewarded. And that money can go to anything besides transfer fees and wages. Sounds 100% fair doesn't it?\n\n>You arguing that these teams, who spent years winning the league, growing themselves on years of hard work and successfully running their clubs, got an unfair advantage by winning things.\n\nThat is a very literal unfair advantage because other clubs cannot close that gap. Leicester were the miracle (the most inspirational win I've ever seen) and look at them now. That is realistically what clubs can hope to achieve with the old clubs being able to spend the way they do.\n\n>The crux is, you were jealous of other teams around you winning everything. You won the lottery by a billionaire buying your club and its soul, to turn their name that stinks of corruption, slavery and human rights abuses into a nice, clean, \u201cgood Samaritan\u201d who have done wonders.\n\nHi Pot I'm Kettel. We can both look back on how jealous we were of Man Utd together and how we don't have to sit through 13/20 seasons where they cleaned house.\n\nThe owner is one thing I will agree with you on. Hate our owners from a moral standpoint. But I don't see him on the pitch when we play. I see players in sky blue playing better than nearly everyone else.\nI would absolutely prefer a Kroenke as an owner.\n\n>And now that you have a taste of winning things that were normally reserved for teams that built their success over years and years, you want to cling on to your success and trot out stuff like \u201cwe earned it\u201d or \u201cthe rules were unfair to begin with\u201d, despite making the rules 10x more unfair than they used to be, but not giving a toss because it\u2019s you who won the lottery.\n\n\"Normally reserved\" reeks of privilege that comes from having an unfair advantage. Spending the same money another club has and beating them on the pitch with players people often call \"overrated\" does shout we earned it. \nHow did we make the rules x10 more unfair? Where did this come from??\n\n\n>It was never a case about how it used to be unfair. It was fair, you win, you get stronger, you get stronger, you win more.\n\nThat is literally unfair, because whoever wins first will nearly always win \ud83e\udd28 \n\n>And as a City fan who has no idea what it\u2019s like to organically accomplish that\n\nI wasn't around back when we won the FA Cup and 1st division. But knowing my club was something before we were taken over stops me from believing \"we were a nothing club\". Organically means what you want it to. I could say Organically includes any funds including the owner of the clubs. But you choose not to. It's a nothing word in this discussion.\n\n>Ignoring the fact that you didn\u2019t earn your position, you didn\u2019t ever compete coming up the table, you didn\u2019t even play fairly once the doors were closed to stop teams like yours gaining success unfairly,\n\nYou act like we won the league all of a sudden and steamroller everyone \ud83d\ude05 ignoring how we actually one our first prem title. And the 3-4 years of ownership before that. We did play fairly. We had the same amount of players on the pitch. \n\nYou are not the arbiter of what is fair or not.\nYou say spending outside your revenue isn't fair.\nI say spending more than anyone else at all isn't fair.\nThe difference is that we chose not to be held down.\n\nI still think it isn't equal. But if it's cheating from us to spend more than wolves, then it's cheating if Arsenal do it too.\nAnd if FFP came out saying every club couldn't spend more than the highest revenue of the newly promoted club in the league, would you follow those rules or winge that this makes the playing ground more even for smaller clubs?\nI think I know\n\n\n>This is why people don\u2019t like City or the owners\n\nThis sounds more like Jealousy of the success than anything.\nI stand with criticism of the owners.

Injury is the only mitigating factor.", "Alisson, Trent, Jota, Jones, Salah and Thiago all to make a miraculous recovery for Sunday IMO", "Notice how I started my comment with \"if\".\n\nIf you go into a game against a rival ahead in the table and a loss would reverse that, then it's yours to lose, sorry but that's literally the meaning of the phrase.", "Dude you are still missing the point. \n\nThe reason the top clubs remain the top clubs is through revenue.\n\nThat's the reward for success.\n\nYou want a system where success is punished. Go down the American route and get rid of relegations and better draft picks for bottom teams.\n\nYes the European model means that it's \"easier\" for top clubs to sustain success but it's not impossible. See Leicester, Sporting and Leverkusen recently\n\nIt's also worth noting, that England has always had a good selection of winners in the top league or Europe.\n\nArsenal. Villa, Forest, United, Liverpool, Chelsea. Blackburn, Leicester, Everton and Leeds.\n\nIt's only recently that it's become dominated by one club (City). It would be even worse if not for Klopp\n\nSo you saying it's unfair unless you cheat because it means the top clubs win all the time, isn't actually true. \n\nCity cheated. There really isn't any denying that. Weather they get punished or not remains to be seen.\n\nIf there were rules and it's a completely open market. Then yeh every club can spend whatever they want.\n\nFact is, there are rules. City broke them.", "I think they just about scrape top 10 for shirt sales last year as well so something doesn\u2019t add up. Maybe it\u2019s all those dodgy sponsorship deals lol", "I disagree on the draw part, City and Arsenal play each other after we play City which means they could draw as well and if we win the same week we\u2019d be back top of the table. \n\nI do agree it\u2019s a worrying situation though with a lot of players out currently, we have to get through these next few matches unscathed and hopefully everyone comes back ASAP.", "You\u2019re a Liverpool fan? Jesus no wonder I\u2019ve never seen you on our sub, you\u2019d get ripped apart with that mentality. \n\nI can see us struggling to beat NFO whilst playing the completely ineffective Gakpo and our 6th choice attacker Harvey EIIiott up front with Bobby Clark at CM. Otherwise we have been comfortable in almost every game besides the Arsenal and City fixtures and should have won our drawn games too. Our GD is even better than City\u2019s. \n\nTime to be more optimistic and back the team and that\u2019s coming from someone who doesn\u2019t often tow the line with some of our fanbase.", "Okay, foul play. Red card. 3 match ban", "I\u2019m not sure when you can say that when literally the next game in the made up scenario is a team that could be top too.", "But that is exactly my point, Leicester and Leverkusen can have a good run for a season, but watch how all their players, manager and probably background staff are picked apart. They cannot sustain dominance without big club status, and they cannot obtain big club status without drastic investment. If you believe that the European big clubs should reap these rewards forever with the occasional other club winning for a season then fair enough, but don't pretend that a club in the conditions of the modern game can become as big without matching the big clubs spending power, and don't take anything away from City's brilliant structure and management to make best use of the investment. Also United and Liverpool have had similar if not more dominant periods in the past not just City now, this is irrelevent to my point I just found your remark that continued dominance is a recent phenomenon strange. Anyway let's just agree to disagree.", "I'm sure I read somewhere (so not sure how true it is)\n\nApparently they buy shirts themselves (under the guise of different companies) and then ship them to 3rd world countries for kids to wear.\n\nAnd this inflates their shirt sales", "I think if we draw, Arsenal runs away with it. \n\nThey've got one hell of a momentum going. \n\nSo do we, to an extent, but it just feels like the players are grinding themselves into the ground, and there's still a lot of games left.", "One always backs the team, wtf are you talking about? \n\nBacking the team does not equate to letting yourself be brainwashed into somehow believing the team is playing better than City. \n\nThey're winning games, which is all that matters, but they're not clicking. It's not flowing and they have to grind out results. Usually, that means that it It's not sustainable.  \n\nCity, on the other hand, are a damn machine. And have a bench that's better than almost everyone's first 11. \n\nBut Liverpool have grit and determination this season, while not playing great. Hopefully it's enough. \n\nWe'll find out on Saturday.", "OP said if it ends a draw this weekend, how are you not grasping my comment is totally related to the permutation that you win and they  draw this weekend!?\n\nAre you on a wind up?", "You can't argue with stupidity mate. You'll get nowhere with this guy. He literally said in another comment that he read somewhere that city buy their own shirts to contribute to sales and ship them off to 3rd world countries lol.", "They love a 3rd party company loophole\nThat dogshit \"\"documentary\"\" on Netflix that's just desperate PR was sold to a 3rd party for millions, and then sold to Netflix for pennies at a massive loss.\n\nHow generous of that 3rd party.", "We still have our bozo gene. I think there\u2019s way too much ball left", "lol the fact you\u2019re that hostile over someone bringing up a potential 1-2 point gap in March is not the gap you think it is.", "The bozo gene might indeed make an appearance. But so far, it seems you've matured from last season. \n\nBut! If it doesn't happen this season, my money is on you for the next one.", "You're right, but it still does not change the fact that if you win this weekend and they draw you win all of your games and the league is yours.\n\nOnly you can bottle the league from here on in.", "Yeah I think we have matured a bit. But that bozo gene and our depth is still lacking a bit. I\u2019d love to run away with it, but with this league in this state. Man I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s clear until it\u2019s double digits in May lol", "Have a 1 point or 2 gap in March doesn\u2019t really seem like a bottle. But to each their own \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc", "Pretty sure City takes it as usual. Their depth is illegally good, and injuries will pile up towards the end, I think. \n\nFucking hope either you guys or Pool wins it, tho. \n\nJust for a change of scenery. And there's about 115 reasons to not care about City winning again, so it would be nice to feel something other than a collective shrug of the shoulders in regards to the title winners.", "I don't care which of you and City win it as long as Klopps parade screeches to a grinding halt personally.", "I\u2019m with you. Be a hell of a run in to end the season", "I respect the hater \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc", "You are dense, lad.", "Hey thanks your comment really contributed to our conversation", "It contributes about as much as all of your comments on the matter. Which is to say, fuck all.", "Hey thanks, I appreciate your insight, you offered nothing but insults. Can you offer a differing opinion or maybe some data to contradict what I\u2019ve said? \n\nNah, instead let\u2019s just hurl insults lol considering this is your quality of analysis I\u2019ll pass https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/s/3m6lkG6PkD", "i would also like to contribute by saying you are a bit stupid"]}}
