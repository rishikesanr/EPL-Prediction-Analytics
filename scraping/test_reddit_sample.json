There is plenty of individual quality and potential there. The issues at Chelsea are largely down to cohesion (most of the minutes are going to players in their 1st full season at the club) and inexperience (the youngest squad in the PL by a long way).

And then sold most of the saleable assets to Man City, Arsenal, Milan, and Man U.\n\nI look at the Chelsea roster now and I don't know who they can really sell.\n\n* Gallagher is probably the best option, since he's pure profit, and there are people who want him.\n* Chalobah maybe. Also pure profit, but he'll have to impress in 12 games for that to really be an option after his injury.\n* Colwell maybe. Similar to Gallagher\n* Raid the massive amount of Academy players? Maybe, but can you really get the millions you would need off of that?\n\nThe real issue is most of chelsea's squad has come in relatively recently on big Transfers. And chelsea has been shit. So they can't just sell them on now. They'll never get what they paid for them, and may have to eat parts of there contract as well. All of this means that they will eat large losses by selling them which doesn't help the FFP issues.\n\nWord is that chelsea have to sell just to make the number this summer let alone paying 100+ for Osimhen.", "Why do you think so?", "When you put it that way\u2026 I too love Chelsea", "I want whatever you\u2019re smoking", "TBF he wasn\u2019t a fan two years ago when they didn\u2019t have Champions League for most of a DECADE", "Lol as far as the world is concerned, Chelsea didn't exist before 2004", "Other clubs in other leagues also pay elite wages and have more clout in other parts of the world \n\nThe Prem was also the best league when Ronnie left for Madrid and now when Mbappes left for Madrid and when Bellingham also went there", "He doesn't do the things Arteta wants from a forward, he is elite at pretty much the things we don't do like fighting for long balls, running in behind. His link up play is ok, he isn't a passer like Arteta likes his strikers (even trying to get Eddie to do it lol).\n\n\nAll that being said he would 100% improve us in the box, better finisher and more dynamic and powerful than anyone we have. Maybe Arteta goes the same route Pep did with Haaland but it doesn't seem likely.l, and it's a gamble for the small fortune Osihmen would cost.\n\n\n\nFor context, we had Auba who profiled similar to him but we ended up playing him wide and actually played better with Laca up front, despite the man moving like he's knee deep in snow. Arteta likes someone who can feed the wingers consistently and that's not Osihmen's thing.", "From what I've seen of him (which admittedly isn't much) he's more of a run and gun player. While it would probably help Arsenal to play a little faster, I don't see it being as fast has what he currently plays. Arsenal or more of a build up team. If he could maintain his finishing in a slower team then he would be great, but that's a bit of an unknown.\n\nAlso, Arsenal are a pretty intricate team that expects a lot form all players in all phases of the game. Again this could just be a style of play issue, and he could pick it up fast if he was at Arsenal, but his defensive numbers and passing numbers are a bit low. Not sure how good he would be in a pressing environment.\n\nLong story short is he's going to cost a lot of money and we have other needs as well. I think there are other cheaper options that are more suited to Arsenal and would allow us to fill some of the other needs as well. They might not be as good as Osimhen, but might be more of what we need.", "Based on unverified estimation since Chelsea haven't released their financial reports for the year.\n\nGivemesport using Fbref as a reference who uses Capology which doesn't have verified wages for everyone.", "Based on UEFA's recently released report for 2023, I doubt it.", "Literally if there's a club in the prem that would lol", "Brother we won the Champions League more recently than you and ours wasn\u2019t a mickey mouse matchup like yours", "Exactly, Liverpool have never let a dickhead play for them.

Dude is the master of not knowing how to pass and almost always missing the net \ud83e\udd2d. Imagine signing him instead of putting more efforts toward Jude or Halland", "Because he's the age Victor will be next summer, \"the others\" were younger and Enzo aside commanded a significantly lesser wage.", "No that would a be a low-iq move only an armchair bloke like yourself could conjure \ud83e\udd2d", "Honestly I don't think we have the money to get osimhen within FFP. In theory, if we assume amortisation is 5 years, and osimhen will be around 150m, that in theory means we only need 30m sales of academy players (pure profit). BUT, that assumes that we are already okay with FFP without these sales. It seems that the desperation to sell Gallagher comes from the fact that we need to balance the books even without a Osimhen transfer. That makes it pretty much impossible to get him. Not to mention, I think selling all the promising academy players and trading them for expensive but worse players isn't a great way to run a club.\n\nAlso, don't think osimhen is the final \"solution\". The issue is our team building has been wack under Bohely. Even if we get a good striker, we're still unbalanced. Enzo and Caiceido, they are really good players, but I honestly don't think they fit together. Both are too slow, and when you have Gallagher pressing up high, the two can't cover an entire midfield. Don't know what we were thinking before buying both.\n\nWingers, especially left wing, is a huge mess. Mudryk has potential, but he's not at the level expected yet. He clearly has talent, but needs a loan (which is absurd for a \u00a362m player). Sterling is so terrible. He has one good game, then does nothing but lose the ball for 4 games.\n\nThe defense isn't terrible, but is also flawed. Without fofana who's always injured, our defence lacks both height and speed. Not a great recipe. Our fullbacks are decent (except cucurella. He's not bad, but he's clearly more of a possession based inverting fullback, not a wide overlapping one we normally use).\n\nAll around poor squad building.", "The Saudi League didn't rescue us at all. We sold them Koulibaly and Mendy for an FFP loss. There were many clubs who were \"rescued\" for a lot more money than Chelsea, but weirdly it was Chelsea who were chastised more than anyone else for it. \n\nThe players that can be sold with no issue are: Maatsen, Chalobah, Broja, Lukaku, Lewis Hall, Kepa, and a handful of other youth, eg - Omari Hutchinson on loan at Ipswich doing quite well. If Ipswich get promoted he could very easily get sold there. \n\nGallagher might be sold, but he could also sign a new contract. It is as yet unclear. Colwill won't be sold, he signed a new long contract and plays often. \n\n>Word is that chelsea have to sell just to make the number this summer let alone paying 100+ for Osimhen.\n\nThat isn't the word at all. I've seen \"the word\" of just about every possibility. David Ornstein has said that Chelsea feel they can still do more without needing to sell immediately.

If we beat Porto, depends on who we get next and already out of the FA cup, we lost to Liverpool.\n\nPredictions can be made with information. Chelsea amortising players over 8 years and spending \u00a31bn was a huge risk at the time. With them not doing any better, the risk is still there and it\u2019s only getting larger.", "He was never our best midfielder. Maybe Arsenal\u2019s best midfielder?", "You mean in a 22/23 season where Chelsea finished 12, where we achieved getting to the Quarter Finals in the UCL & third round for the FA Cup & EFL Cup? Jorginho made 3 assists & scored 1 goal that season. Yeah our best midfielder in an absolutely abysmal season\u2026", "He wasn\u2019t our best midfielder. He was the most available. Kante was our best midfielder. Our midfield needed an overhaul. We looked cooked. Kante and Kova were constantly injured. Jorgi is great but you need someone around him to do all the defensive work. He looks great now with rice and odegard because they do a lot of the work around him. He can sit in front of the back line, facilitate and break up play if needed.", "I love how many people act like we're in this shit because we sold the experienced players and not the fact they were the ones that oversaw the first few months of it.", "They've likely been met already. Our tier 1 journos without telling us the specifics, said the conditions were so low that there's no way we won't trigger them. Again no one has specified what they are but thoughts are it's stuff like \"transfer becomes permanent if Newcastle avoid relegation\".", "It was a loan with conditions which if met would make the transfer permanent. From what our journos have said the conditions are so easy to hit that basically there's no way we don't sign him, even though he's not featured much.", "Holy shit, I had absolutely no idea it was that bad. \n\nAnd are all the Boehly signings amortised like this?!", "[deleted]", ">If you are relegated, your club is dead\n\nso like I said a Leeds situation... thanks for making it more clear. some reason i think he will find a way out of this if not wow was that a wild blunder by his part with his money", "I\u2019m sure you were all saying that at the bridge when he finished 3rd in the Balon D\u2019Or.", "No when you won the CL. \n\nChrist you lot changed your tune, all you did that year was cry that he didn\u2019t win the Balon D\u2019Or now he\u2019s crucial to a much better Arsenal team and he was just average then - copuim is a hell of a drug haha.", "God that was even more brutal than my memory is trying to block it out\u00a0", "You lot campaigned all year that he should get the Balon D\u2019Or and now he wasn\u2019t even that good- copuim haha.", "I never said that. I referenced the article which OP inaccurately said was BS about Chelsea selling off players last year- which is exactly what they did.", "Ah yeah that makes sense, almost like they have to include something so may as well just say \"avoid relegation\"", "Mostly all of them yes. They were nowhere close to earning \u00a31bn in revenue in a year, so to get around the FFP rules, that despite City and Chelsea\u2019s proclaims that it\u2019s to keep the poor poor and the rich rich, it\u2019s designed specifically to stop silly shit like this.\n\nAmortising the transfer fee over the contract length is nothing new. But making contracts 7-8 years is how Chelsea spread that amount over 8 years instead of 4-5 like normal.\n\nThe only way they could have spent that much and stay within the FFP would have been to amortise almost every single player in that \u00a31bn spending spree.\n\nChelsea don\u2019t just want to be in Europe and win the league, they NEED to be in Europe and start winning things to increase their income.\n\nTheir future is ridiculously bleak. We are watching a gruesome car crash in super slow motion.", "What reports say you have \u00a3200m to spend?", "You keep saying he. You mean \u201cChelsea\u201d. \n\nChelsea needs to find a way out of it and the only way they can do that is to increase their revenue. More short term, it\u2019s your academy players, because your amortised players have no resale value from an FFP standpoint.\n\nReece James, Gallagher, Broja, etc are all in the firing line.\n\nYes, it was a wild blunder, but it\u2019s not his money that he has risked, it\u2019s your club\u2019s future.\n\nYou are looking at points deductions and you aren\u2019t doing so well in the league. Even in this Uber wealthy league, you are falling behind more than \u00a3150m on what you are allowed to lose. If you drop into the Championship, that will drop by another \u00a3150m. Which will lead to more breaches of the FFP rules, more deductions, more possible relegations. \n\nSitting in the Championship with a yearly loss of \u00a3400m-500m with 4-5 more years of amortisation to pay off, could be realistic.\n\nHow long do you think the lights are going to stay on for?\n\nYou won\u2019t go the way of Leeds. Your club will literally disappear.", "Nah. We had Kante. Only a delusional like yourself would think otherwise", "So our best midfield player was the guy whose best season was 2-3 seasons ago? Do you read what you\u2019re typing or are you just plain dumb?", "[deleted]", "Nope. This is classic poverty Arsenal talk. Win a trophy and then talk to us about our best players", "\u201cYou lot\u201d I was never in that group pal. His ballon d\u2019or case was weak. Just because Italy won the euros. They outlasted every team they played. Hardly impressive. Anyone who thought that Messi or lewa wasn\u2019t going to win was delusional. If iniesta never won jorgi definitely wouldn\u2019t win.", "Yeah, this transfer was done in a way to bypass FFP and get the 30m onto next years accounts rather than this year. Easy conditions make this happen.", "Is it not somewhat amusing that the first team to \"buy\" the league could be the first to fall apart?\n\nThough personally I don't think they will fall apart, Barcelona are in a similar boat and constantly find new assets to sell every year to stay in it", ">, but it\u2019s not his money that he has risked, \n\nwhat money did he use to buy the team ?", "On the contrary it was all the delusional blues screaming everywhere about it. I remember I was there .", "You can\u2019t read what I write lol. Keep moving the argument to things I\u2019m not saying.", "Ok you sold your best midfielder to Saudi? City? United? You sold your entire midfield one of them by default was the best.", "Hahahahahaha- you think I\u2019m an Arsenal fan. I\u2019ll give you another guess- I just celebrated a trophy win!", "You\u2019re in the minority, as far as I\u2019ve seen. Fair play. He also still finished 3rd. Which is wild.", "Chelsea have nowhere close to Barca\u2019s reputation. Nor do they have access to any more levers.", "You misunderstand. \n\nThe worst thing that can happen for Todd is that he loses some money.\n\nThe worst thing that can happen for Chelsea, is that they disappear as a club and you Chelsea fans will have no team. Literally.", "\u201cI remember I was there\u201d From your basement? I think the delusions are kicking in again", "you quite literally said he was our best player midfielder & we sold him to Arsenal? Implying he was our best player when we sold him\u2026. then you said you meant when \u201caLl cHelSeA fAnS\u201d were crying about him not winning Ballon D\u2019Or which is just untrue lol. \n\nJorginho won the Euros with Italy alongside the UCL he won with us. This contributed to him being 3rd. Thinking about it, he still had a better claim to winning it than Mane lmao, just for your dumb brain that\u2019s not me saying i thought Jorginho should\u2019ve won it\u2026 now you\u2019re in other comments asking who our best player was during that period. \n\nMoron, not going to respond anymore cuz you\u2019re clearly new to watching \u201csOcCeR\u201d.", "[deleted]", "Oh the team that will look even more poverty when Salah takes the Saudi money and Van Dijk finally ages out?", "lol what a take. you really think he is going to take a multi billion hit ? thats a tad more than  SOME money", "Rattled mate. Haha. State of this reply which ends in \u201cnOT gOIng To ReSpONd\u201d oh no I\u2019m devastated.", "Yes, by default one is the best, which is what I said. Keep up.", "Classic poverty Chelsea talk. Win a final then talk about our best players.", "Again, missing the point.\n\nHe can strip your entire club for parts and make half of it back.", "You\u2019re right, I\u2019ll get you a little rattle for your childish brain mate. Would you like a dummy too?", "We just won a Champions League and it wasnt a mickey mouse one like yours", "you said it wouldnt be a club anymore... what would he even sell and to who ?", "Oh my days. A response. Thought you were a man of principle. These responses are hilariously ironic though.", "Oh yeah Champions League eh? Big man got 2 of those, well in- we\u2019ve got 6 haha. Mickey Mouse club more like! Oh how desperately bitter you are about losing a Mickey Mouse cup haha.", "Ok but lets not forget u also just said win a final which shows how little you know. When you\u2019ve improved the brain cell count so that u have any cursory knowledge then try again u bloke"]}}
