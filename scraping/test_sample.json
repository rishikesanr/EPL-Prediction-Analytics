That team will have learned a lot from last seasons failings and thus far appear to be getting stronger with 26 goals in their last 5 games conceding only 4 with Newcastle, West Ham and Liverpool being some of those games. They will be loving the fact that they are waltzing around in 2nd with no apparent pressure and are playing freely because people are blindsided by Liverpool and City.", "The biggest problem with this sub is recency bias. \n\nIt\u2019s amusing how so much of this sub thinks what happened the last game will continue to happen for the next 10-11 games of the season. And when it doesn\u2019t the most recent games becomes the benchmark lol.", "I don\u2019t see us winning without Salah. He absolutely terrorises City, Gakpo leading the line doesn\u2019t exactly instill confidence in me given how bad he\u2019s been of late.", "Arsenal have beaten both Liverpool and City in the league this year. To write them off is ridiculous.", "Nope. It\u2019s a three horse race and it still will be after the weekend.", "I can see this game ending as a tie with Arsenal sneaking back to the top of the table", "This is not exactly a decider yet bec there's still 10 games left... But yeah wining it would make a lot of difference for either Liverpool or City", "No matter how well arsenal are playing, it\u2019s obvious city are still the favourites. I believe we have a chance of beating them with the Anfield factor but watching them yesterday made me think again that it\u2019s one thing trying to stop de Bruyne and Haaland, but then silva and foden pop up in little spaces, and stones and Rodri have acres in which to control the game. Idk maybe part of it is United can\u2019t compete against the better teams currently but I was much more confident before that game when city had just scraped past Brentford and Bournemouth", "Liverpool fan but realistic. The last few feel good matches were not against the likes of City. With KDB back, Foden playing well and Haaland scoring again it\u2019s just too big an ask for the available Liverpool players.", "I'm surprised people are ruling out Liverpool already, the line up will probably be  \nKelleher (who had been immense since alisson got injured)  \nBradley/Gomez  \nKonate  \nVan Dijk  \nRobertson  \nEndo  \nMac Allister  \nSzoboszlai  \nSalah/Elliot (if Salah hasn't recovered)  \nNunez  \nDiaz\n\nThat's a very strong line up with the only people not in form at the moment are Szoboszlai are Robertson and it's not like they've been shocking either. The bench is where the issues begin with Tsimikas, one right back, and maybe elliot being the only senior players from before this year with Quansah providing some experience, and Danns being the only other player that even really has a chance to impact the game positively for Liverpool. With youngsters like McConnell, Clark filling out the rest of the bench. What really caused us issues against forest was the lack of ruthlessness between Diaz, Gakpo, and Elliot. But Nunez will definitely bring that like he always does and Salah will too if he's available.", "You being top if City and Arsenal draw after a Liverpool vs City draw is assuming no points are dropped by any of the teams in the other games. Obviously any of the 3 teams could drop points but Liverpool are seemingly running on fumes.\n\nI am an Arsenal fan so my take is with a hint of bias/optimism, but you have to admit Arsenal are in outstanding form. Not only that, but while Liverpool keep sustaining injuries, which is extremely unfortunate, Arsenal are getting back several players. We just saw Thomas Partey and Gabriel Jesus feature today for Arsenal. Even if Thomas Partey is back for just 6 games, we\u2019ll have the best midfield in the league for those 6 games, it just doesn\u2019t get much better than Partey, Rice and Odegaard. Jesus getting fit is brilliant for rotation and the fact that he enables so much of what we like to do going forward. \n\nCity is the ultimate question, as they always seemingly turn it up a gear and never go down. Did Arsenal go up a gear too early? Can they sustain it? Can Liverpool keep chugging along and managing wins while dealing with their substantial injury list, can City turn it up and beat not only Liverpool at Anfield, but still to play Arsenal (even if it\u2019s at the Ethiad). As good as City are, they\u2019ve got the most pressure on them imo, still to play both of the top 3, one away from home, expected to beat Arsenal even if they\u2019re on form like this at home and they\u2019ve got the pressure of winning the league for the past 3 seasons, winning a 4th time in a row would make history. \n\nSuch a crazy end to the season we\u2019re in for tbh, could be one of the best title charges we\u2019ve seen which is a blessing to us football fans regardless of the club we support.", "As much as I don\u2019t want to think of this as title deciding, watching city on Sunday made me think Liverpool are gonna need to beat them as it feels like if we don\u2019t then nobody else will take points off them, and being only one point ahead with several tricky away games remaining is not a comforting thought", "We beat City last year at Anfield. Even with all the injuries this team is still better than what we had last year so I believe in us. But it\u2019s still going to be a long and difficult game", "Well its kinda suck that we are going there with half team but it is what it is", "You\u2019ll be making a grave mistake by writing off Arsenal.", "Given the players actually on the pitch, surely Liverpool\u2019s \u201ckids\u201d have less exposure to title pressure than last year\u2019s runners up?\n\nI don\u2019t know how you can just rule out the most in-form team in the league right now, when they\u2019re just 2 points away and could be top before and after the Liverpool/City game.", "If we can't win it then I hope Liverpool do. Klopp and this Liverpool team deserve that.", "As an Arsenal fan, I'm of course hoping for a draw - if everything stays close and we end up tied with either of them on points, our healthy goal differential will tell the tale.\n\nIf someone has to win, I would rather it be Liverpool. Even though Liverpool is further ahead of us in the table, City is such a juggernaut in the spring that any time there is a chance for them to drop points, we need them to do it. Plus, if Arsenal can't win the tile, I would rather see Liverpool win it than Manchester 115 FFP Violations City.", "It pains me to say this but it feels like Liverpool winning to close out Klopps career in the PL is the storybook ending that they make movies about", "Well, pool were missing 7 starters this past game. So yeah, gonna be tough to win, even in anfield", "I hope that its 1-1, with City leading until the 91st minute and then conceding a goal from a dodgy ref decision in Liverpool\u2019s favor.\n(I\u2019m salty about Foden\u2019s 2 goals on Sunday)", "If Liverpool draw with City and then Arsenal beat City which looks possible then Arsenal would be in the driving seat", "An argument that not a lot people talk of when brining up Arsenal last season is the Saliba injury. Saliba being out at the end of last season played a big part in Arsenal dropping points, Rob Holding at the back\u2026", "Arsenal do have toughest of schedule with most tough matches being away - spurs Man U and city. Arsenal lost some silly points in first half of season which is going to come back and bite us in the ass !!", "I don't know how we beat City with the squad available, but we're going into every game with the energy of a fully-fit squad regardless.  One last hurrah!\n\nI'd say a City win puts them firmly in the driving seat, but there will be more deciders I imagine.  There are still so many games left.", "Arsenal has grown a lot. I said it last season that they werent ready. The way they celebrated certain victories, with Ramsdale shouting the most. They just wasnt ready. Their squad is bigger, and they are more experienced. My favourites. \nMy club Liverpool need to find themself a witch-doctor or something. Cant have 10 people out for a much longer period. \nCity is City. They still dominate games, but they havent been as good as they were before. But.. They have Haaland and Rodri. And the ball all the time.", "Current form - Arsenal absolutely stomp City", "Liverpool's kids have more experince than Arsenal's squad, which has PL winners (Jesus, Zinchenko) and UL winners (Havertz and Jorginho)?\n\nWell... shit.", "Arsenal have beaten Liverpool and city this season, Arsenal still have to play city away. Liverpool scrapped a last minute winner over the weekend and have been digging for results. In all honesty, it\u2019s a 3 horse race and very difficult to predict. One thing that\u2019s guaranteed is that it\u2019s a lot more exciting than what we\u2019ve been seeing in the last few seasons", "Don\u2019t think Arsenal would crumble again that easily this time given the injuries in those top 3 teams. Hope we win this Sunday but you can\u2019t just rule out those Londoners in the title race", "I see another score draw; i dont think this or Arsenal v City decides the title.", "As they\u2019re playing 1st, 3rd and 4th in the next three if City win all three they win the title, it\u2019s that simple. There\u2019ll be no three way title race, there\u2019ll be a procession. There\u2019s not a single game after that I wouldn\u2019t expect them to win comfortably. Their only tricky away is Spurs, but City in title-mode will most likely easily win that. Of course weird things can happen. But by that point they\u2019d be 2 ahead of Liverpool and 4 ahead of Arsenal. Liverpool have to visit Villa Park, Goodison and Old Trafford, points will be dropped. Arsenal have to visit Spurs and Old Trafford, points will be dropped. \n\nI know a lot of Liverpool and Arsenal fans seem to want a draw for the other one\u2019s game against City, but both sets should want City to lose both of those games and hope that Villa can catch them reeling. Otherwise you just add 24 points to City\u2019s total and see what you\u2019ll be chasing. The best chance for either Arsenal or Liverpool to win the title is in a race against each other.", "Liverpool only won their last game in very last minute. So many injuries, not much option from the bench to change the game unless Salah is back. \n\nCity\u2019s form is on the rise. From last few matches KDB is good for one half of the game however Foden & Haaland is picking up form. Only Grealish & Gvardiol is out. \n\nThe odds are against Liverpool.", "YNWA we have 12 players in this stadium. Anfield road upgrade and the kop will be loud. We\u2019ve got this. Salah should be back I say he plays like closing couple mins against Sparta and then starts on Sunday", "On paper should be a city win but in reality it could go either way. Liverpool are in great form and even when they are playing badly they are still managing to get results, luck also seems to be on their side. We are also historically poor at Anfield and along with spurs away it's normally our toughest game of the season.\n\nShould be a good game.", "Still way early to say.\n\nEverything and anything is unpredictable at this point.\n\nAll 3 are a threat.\n\n-1 of them is a fucking treble title rocket who are on fire atm.\n\n-1 of them has the club's passion and team spirit/ creativity to pull of winners with academy kids and ET goals.\n\n-1 of them is a young squad full of drive and determination but lacks experience in keeping it mentally together in last 10 games of season (including international fixtures).\n\nThis could go anyway though City have the edge at the moment (fully fit blazing experienced squad).", "As a Liverpool fan, I just don't see how we beat them. We are really running on bare bones at the moment. Home advantage might see us get a draw. The good thing is that a draw is a decent result for us. If city and arsenal draw we are still top and it's in our hands not needing to play either of them again.\n\nIf we win... Holy fuck. It's on. But I'm not getting my hopes up.", "The league will not be decided in March that\u2019s ridiculous", "City won't win at Anfield. I'm almost certain of that.\n\n  \nthe situation could be perfect, Klopps' last hurrah, them coming to Liverpool. injuries can ruin it. hopefully we get some players back in time. a Gravenberch miracle healing could prove vital", "pool without salah vs in-form city has to favor city", "Liverpool looks stronger than City. City doesn\u2019t look like the squad that dominated RM like a boss last year. For me, Liverpool are the favourites.", "If we win on Sunday, it's 100% coming home", "Arsenal look like the best team in the League.", "City will beat Liverpool and arsenal will beat city", "Please keep writing off Arsenal. It's just more evidence of the historical bias that most people seem to have.\n\nAll three teams are a threat. All three teams have a shot unless they start losing stupid games, and fall significantly back. \n\nPersonally I rank them in this order, but its tight no matter how you rank them. Any of them could win.\n\n1. Man City - Good underlying stats. Very few injuries at the moment. Slightly easier schedule than Arsenal at the moment. At this point there's nothing to suggest they will have a dip in form.\n2. Arsenal - Very good underlying stats, though they have underperformed to those stats to some extent. In a pretty good spot injury wise with most of them seem to be coming back relatively soon (knock on wood). Tough they do have the hardest remaining league schedule of the three.\n3. Liverpool - Statistically they've overperformed a little this season. Not a ton. I'm not suggesting they are a distant third by any stretch, but think they might have 2 or 3 less points if they weren't out performing there xGA so much. Injuries and fixture congestion are the biggest issue here. Its highly likely that they will go deep in the FA cup and Europa league, which means a lot of games with a thin squad. Which I think increases there chance to drop points relative to the other contenders.", "I just hope the ref's and VAR will not fuck this game up.\n\nAfter Liverpool, City still have to play Arsenal, Spurs and Newcastle. I don't think they will beat Arsenal even though they play at the Emptyhad, and with Spurs away it's never an easy game. Newcastle can also put up a fight.\n\nI expect this to be a three horse race up till the last round. It might even come down to goal difference.", "Actually hope city wins and then arsenal can win city and take reins. We are banging goals like crazy right now so...", "City's next 3 matches across March is Liverpool, Newcastle, Arsenal. All 3 would be critical in determining the title, not just next week's. I think both Liverpool and Arsenal have a decent chance of edging them, and with Arsenal's big wins and 45+ GD, they are the dark horse. personally, despite being Chelsea fan, I am a big admirer of Klopp and would not mind seeing him get a fairytale farewell.", "\u201cI don\u2019t like Arsenal because of the last ten years and base opinions off of the Pablo Mari years\u201d", "I can bet my house on City this weekend, i really don't see a scenario where they let 3 points slip away.\nThis is way too important for both teams, but nobody gets close to an in form city. Liverpool will most likely get caught in their injuries sooner or later, I don't see them keeping this form for much longer with the squad they offer at the moment.", "Liverpool are not in the strongest position right now. While City are at pretty much full strength, only missing Grealish. They will be lucky to draw.\n\nThe rest of the season is hard to call. Arsenal have to face City and Spurs away but otherwise have a fairly easy schedule. City have to face Spurs away but otherwise they should win the rest. Could have a draw or two in there. Liverpool have easily the toughest schedule. City and Spurs plus Villa away. They are also going through a bit of an injury crisis, not as bad as Spurs or Newcastle faced earlier but still bad.\n\nI would say it\u2019s looking like another City title. Arsenal to place 2nd and it will be close. Liverpool 3rd and they\u2019ll be looking to keep clear of Villa and Spurs. A lot will come down to Spurs since they play all 3 at home. Whoever they fail to beat (if any) will likely win the title. If they win all 3 by some miracle then it could become a 4-team race (6-point differential on all 3 teams with a game in hand).", "I do think this year Man City will drop points up to the end of the season, biggest threats to drop points are Liverpool, Arsenal and Spurs. \n\nArsenal are absolutely flying at the moment and with the experience of coming close last season will definitely give them a stronger mentality, I think this time they could do the job.\n\nI feel like Liverpool's luck will run out soon due to the injuries and struggling to keep up with the squad depth in the remaining competitions. As a Liverpool fan I really do think we have to beat Man City on Sunday if we want to win the league.", "Which is better result for Arsenal Liverpool loss or draw?", "Man City struggles against United, Haaland is overrated, De Bruyne is also going on a steep decline in quality", "City gonna smack them. Their side is just too weak unless they get Salah back.", "City, Arsenal, Liverpool imo", "Unless Alisson comes back, Kelleher will let Liverpool down. Salah might be back though, so Liverpool won't be a walk over.", "Plus, Brighton away and Villa at Home.\n\nThat\u2019s 5 teams in the top 9 excluding Chelsea who on any given day can turn up potentially.", "They beat city twice already this season. No reason to think it's not a possibility considering recent form.", "It's just historical bias.\n\nPeople always over index prior seasons. That boosts Liverpool and Man City and makes them slow to acknowledge Arsenal due to past failings.\n\nIts a tight race, much more than most people want to acknowledge.", "I think still having Tottenham, yous, city, Brighton away is the main reason people are still skeptical of arsenal. \n\nI don't think city or Liverpool will be but they have the toughest fixtures remaining.", "\u2018Waltzing around in 2nd\u2019 - Haven\u2019t been 2nd at the end of a week\u2019s fixtures since Boxing Day \u2026", "I\u2019m hopeful for a Diaz, Nu\u00f1ez, Salah frontline with a Mac, Endo, Szobo midfield. That\u2019s basically our starting 6, with only Trent missing from our best XI, the problem is our depth, where we would have just Gakpo and Elliott as attacking subs and basically just Elliott and Clark and midfield subs.\nIf Salah and Szobo are fit to start that\u2019ll be our front 6 with then just the RB spot undetermined between Gomez and Bradley", "How long salah will be out?", "Liverpool have got 0 chance to win this year with all of the injuries. My money is on Arsenal and Man City.", "Amen", "If Liverpool go 4 points clear then they'll be the run away favorites. If it's a draw I could see arsenal putting up a serious challenge but they have the hardest fixtures left of the three. If City win then they really just have arsenal  at home to contend with. I don't see them dropping any points after that game.", "United are absolutely terrible though. Endo, Mac Allister and Szoboszlai will give them a better battle in the midfield.", "The second and third goals were mostly to united errors \n\nBut then there's also their first goal and the haaland miss, etc", "I\u2019m not sure how much better off United is at the moment than a lot of lower table teams. The players are one thing but I honestly believe that Ten Haag is out of his depth. They were so disorganized in attack and the subs were baffling, both the profile and the timing. \n\nI know that City grows into both games and seasons and that, ultimately, they\u2019re probably inevitable. Obviously the team is still mostly monsters. But I can\u2019t help but think that there\u2019s a weakness being exposed. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s less cohesion in the squad after the summer\u2019s sales, complacency after the treble, I don\u2019t know. I actually think they are capable of slipping up in the same way that Pool and Arsenal could.", "Haaland was atrocious against man united. If united had a better squad they'd have taken points. They had Evans at CB like.", "You say that but we have our first choice midfield back, first choice front 3 assuming Salah is back which I think he will, therefore we are only missing Trent (Bradley has been excellent) and Alisson (Kelleher also been fantastic). It\u2019s not as bad as it seems. Need a big EL win to get the confidence high and some minutes in the returning players legs tho", "Liverpool\u2019s main strength this season has been the bench though, they\u2019ve built a squad with the idea of being able to use 5 subs to change games drastically. Our starting XI has been used largely to keep the game close enough to do damage in the 2nd half. \n\nIt\u2019s Anfield under the lights though, which is a big factor. Unless City can do enough damage to silence the place it will be rocking.", "I still think Man City have a great shot at beating Liverpool and if so then everything is wide open again. Plus with all 3 front runners also playing in Europe midweek I think it's gonna be super close but I would say with the form Arsenal are in they have every chance of coming out on top.", "I have an equal amount of bias to you but I think it does get better than partey/rice/odegaard. It\u2019s called Rodri/KDB/Silva. KDB and Rodri are arguably the best two midfielders in the world atm.", "United was terrible in the second half. \n\nAs much as I can still see them doing their typical end season run, city still looks vulnerable currently", "I\u2019m thinking about 90 minutes", "The pessimist in me doesn't think we'll do it (hope I'm wrong). But a lot of people are arrogantly writing us off.", "Christ on a bike, first comment from a Liverpool fan I've seen in ages who recognises that it's an actual three horse race.\n\nWell played.", "I am not writing them off just saying that I think they will crumble just like last season. It\u2019s a very young talented team. But experience is what wins you titles in my opinion.", "Baffles me how people wrote you off earlier when you had a couple of bad results. I think Arsenal are in this title race till the end, and always were.", "You can't call Diaz, Nunez, Salah, Endo, Macca, Szobo, Robbo, VVD, Gomez kids actually. Most of them have faced 'title pressure' before.\n\nBut Arsenal are intimidatingly close, yes. Man City vs Arsenal will decide it if Liverpool loses or draws", "It\u2019s unlikely any kids apart from Bradley and potentially Elliott (who\u2019s got the winning experience) actually play that much with our players returning, especially after the int break I don\u2019t expect many appearances for the kids in the league", "Stfu dumbass arsenal fan\ud83d\ude02", "Can\u2019t see us getting enough points in the next few weeks with the amount of key players out. Saw remaining fixtures earlier and really think itll be you guys taking it this season, even with the random city form they seem to find every year", "Goal difference can easily swing back, we (City) are 10 goals behind Arsenal, Liverpool only 6 and that's despite you winning your last four 21-1. If you even draw a couple games from now on, City or Liverpool can make up that difference no problem.", "Yeah, hoping for a draw feels good in the moment but it\u2019s short sighted. Liverpools injuries will make it more difficult for them to keep consistent. City have the players and history of great form at the end of the season. Liverpool are more likely to drop points later and like you said, I\u2019d rather to the title race to them.", "I wouldn\u2019t mind that at all\u2026 because he has brought this club back to life and what an ending that would be!", "Klopp said he would leave if they ever make a docuseries in Liverpool. He's making his own.", "Then again anfield is a fortress when spurred on, so I reckon Liverpool will get a result here. Obviously my flair hopes the match ends in a draw.", "We don\u2019t have experience keeping 10-12 winning streaks towards the end of the league.", "This was absolutely it.", "Heads were also gone. Everyone saw Arsenal drop 2+ goal leads 3 weeks in a row, that's not because a single player is missing", "Because of the tough away matchups that\u2019s why I have this feeling that they will drop more silly points.", "If Salah and Szobo start we will only really be missing Trent and Ali from our best XI, debatable about Jota/Diaz and Endo/Jones, although I think Endo has become near essential. The problem is when we turn to the bench we\u2019ve got about 60% kids", "I would love to be playing them this weekend rather than after the 3 week break tbh. Would be an immense game given both our current forms.", "I wouldn't be this confident Arsenal are flying, but the fixture list has also been kind.", "They couldn't even stomp Porto and you think they will stomp the city?", "Delulu", "Havertz?", "Also it depends what Liverpool shows up, but they definitely have the passion to go for it all they can. But we all know City can show up when they want and get that top spot. I think City will definitely show up these next few games, they always do at some point to shatter other teams hopes", "I still think Liverpool win this weekend. It's just got to happen sometime. City can't just walk the league, they seem quite complacent this year.", "Given that there\u2019s only 2 pts in it, definitely not.

That\u2019s assuming Arsenal beat Brentford and we win against Brighton at the end of the month.\n\nIt\u2019ll really be 1 and 3 points clear with a game in hand as the Everton game\u2019s been postponed but you get what I mean.", "Ye I thought they'd win comfortably when they lost to Wolves. No game is free\u00a0", "I disagree,\n\nBest chance for either arsenal or Liverpool to win is for the other to draw and themselves to win.\n\nGaining 5 on city + 2 on other rival > 6 city because it puts it the most in your own hands.\n\nLiverpool winning against city could be what they need to run the league for example", "Liverpool at home gives them a huge advantage though", "Loud for the doest 7 minutes then silence unless they score. Every week", "I'd say on paper it *could* be a city win but it still bodes for liverpool that Van Djik has only lost once at Anfield in the league and Pep has never won at Anfield with a crowd.", "Pure SkySports opinions. Everything you said about Liverpool describes Arsenal too, except our academy kids have three seasons of this now, I.e. more experience than yours.\n\nStrange how playing with passion and youth is detrimental when it's Arsenal, but a benefit for you. Do you what derailed us last season? Injuries.\n\nYou'll remember how that feels pretty soon, I suspect.", "Assuming all those that played at Nottingham are fit, and if we want to gamble with throwing them straight into the fray, we can put out a team of:\n\nKelleher\n\nBradley/gomez, Konate, Vvd, Robertson\n\nEndo, macallister, szoboszlai,\n\nDiaz, Gakpo, Nunez\n\nBench : Adrian, elliot, Gomez, salah? (depends on his fitness)  Danns, Tsimikas, Quansah, McConnell, Clark/Koumas.\n\nOutside of Salah I'd say that starting 11 is actually pretty good.

Let's face it, it was an extra time goal against the bottle jobs, victory over Luton where they gave a lot of chances away and a last second goal against Forest. To think these kids are going to be able to hold a full strength citeh is delusional.

Liverpool is really makeshift now and it nearly showed against Forest, and will surely show against City.", "Half our first team is injured ??", "City still have another gear to go up and we\u2019ve all seen City find that top gear during the run in. I reckon they\u2019ll hit top form vs Liverpool and then go on to win the league.", "Liverpool is squeezing out late winners with a banged up team right now. (Legitimately impressive that they are). It\u2019s a good time\nfor City to play them, would have loved to have seen LFC lose points while they had to field some youth. Once everyone is back it will be scary. \n\nArsenal is definitely the team to beat at the moment. They are steamrolling", "I have the same feeling\u2026", "Does City have an easier schedule?

We\u2019re missing a lot of players but with Szobo and potentially Salah back we\u2019ll be able to put out a strong side with injuries mainly impacting our depth. Obviously Trent and Ali are huge misses are they\u2019re 2 of our most important players, but we\u2019re a side that\u2019s really hard to beat. \n\nMy prediction is a draw with optimistic hopes of a win", "Bruh what Liverpool has the easiest of the remaining fixtures. City home, spurs home and villa away, Man U away. Arsenal has city away, villa at home, spurs away, man united away. City has villa at home Liverpool away Arsenal at home and spurs away.

United are shite are I expect Arsenal to put 4 past them. \n\nBasically what I\u2019m saying is I expect them to win all but Spurs and City but footy isn\u2019t played on paper so who knows what\u2019ll happen", "Arsenal just beat 3 teams in the top 10 by an aggregate of 13-2, winning the one away game 6-0.

Nothing seems like a chore and they are finding goals really easy to come by.\nSpurs could be an issue being a derby, city will be a draw and United and Brighton I don\u2019t see troubling them.", "Honestly I\u2019d be quite happy with that. Harvey has been a great impact sub for us and I think playing a more facilitating role can only help Gakpo. Let\u2019s not forget Klopp has tried him in midfield too and Joe Gomez has done decent job as a six.\n\nWeirdly enough I have the most confidence in our defensive line for this one and that\u2019s without Trent and Ali.

For me, at least at Arsenal, Partey is so crucial that system and team I\u2019d argue that as a trio it\u2019d be arguably the best in the world. At the end of the day, City\u2019d midfield is also exceptional, we can argue all day but we\u2019re really splitting hairs here as both when fit are exceptional and would be the finest of margins. \n\nPeople imo massively underrate Partey mostly because he\u2019s become so injury prone. What Rodri is to you guys (you notice when he\u2019s out) Partey is to us. Rice obviously has been a superb addition to the Arsenal midfield that had helped cover for his absence, but at least for how Arsenal play, I don\u2019t think anyone does his role better, at least not with the players we have at Arsenal. His link up from the defence to the attack is just unreal and he brings our transition to another level when he is fit. I also an keen to see how Rice looks more so at the 8 with less of a defensive workload.

Diaz has been hot and cold this year, Gakpo has largely been shit recently too.\n\nI'm not particularly confident given city's current form with KDB and Foden on fire.", "If Salah gets minutes against Sparta I expect him to start against City and if so then we\u2019re really only missing Ali, Trent and maybe Jones and Jota from our starting XI, it\u2019s just the depth where we have big problems", "They have lost against Liverpool with better teams when Liverpool were weaker.", "maybe. as I said, injuries are the only reason I can see why City would win", "Winning with a depleted squad is more impressive than city putting 3 past united.

Darwin, Endo, and Szoboszlai all fit to start sunday, and potentially Salah too. Biggest misses as things stand are Alisson and Trent, but Kelleher, Bradley, and Gomez have all been in great form so we look well covered in those areas.", "Arsenal is looking ominous actually. Especially since the start of 2024. Liverpool though, looks very motivated. Probably on account of Klopp\u2019s last season in PL. They are digging in deep. Even with a depleted squad, they are still a huge threat any day.", "Personally I think you lot are still the favorites. And while we have had some good wins recently none of those came against a team anywhere close to Citys level. I think you guys may just have too much for us on Sunday. \n\nArsenal are really looking phenomenonal of late. Arguably the tightest title race I can remember.", "I think of fixture congestion and Schedule quality as two different things.\n\nThe fact that they are still in the FA cup might be a little bit of an advantage for Arsenal, but I don't think its huge. They'll play 3 extra games at most in the FA cup. On top of that Arsenal will have similar congestion issues, because our Chelsea game is moved due to the FA cup.\n\nFixture congestion is just so hard to pin down. A bad result against Newcastle, and they are out and any advantage is gone. Same could happen in the champions league. for both teams. And all that said, Man City had a lot of Fixture congestion last year ad still won 12 straight in the run in.", "Ahh right, my bad. I didn't pay attention.", "Will still affect form and momentum. If city are out of the cup, they only have the league and champions league to win so pressure mounts. City should be retaining every title based on the money spent over the years so it's a failure to only win one. High expectations.", "Well I sure hope not.\n\nA draw would be best there.", "No, I think city will lose to Liverpool and then follow up by being beat by Newcastle in the cup then get dismantled by high scoring arsenal. Arsenal won't win the league though. That's Liverpool.", "No they weren't. Commentators and rival fans were saying that.", "People like to say Arsenal bottled it, but they ignore the fact Arsenal lost key players in the run up like Saliba, Gabriel J and Partey and had a bench with the likes of Cedric, Elneny and Nketiah, but this year with the additions of Havertz and Rice in the starting 11, who rarely get Injured, it looks like they'll have a good bench in the run in with the likes of Timber, Partey, Zinchenko, Tomiyasu and Gabriel J returning in the coming weeks for the run in", "Misremembered the Liverpool games, yeah City def has the easiest schedule in that case. Doesn\u2019t change my predictions though, because City this weekend will be very difficult for Liverpool and so will Villa away.", "Yeah, have you seen their performances, every time I watch city play Haaland he is missing sitters. De Bruyne was aiming at the top of the stadium vs Man United. They barely beat Man U, Bournemouth, Brentford, and couldn\u2019t beat Chelsea.", "True. They could do what they did this season and lose to Villa, West Ham and Fulham in the span of 4 game weeks. \n\nI\u2019m just saying, a lot of football to be played and I\u2019m certain us, you and City are going to face some further injuries.", "Did they not win?", "Yea Harvey\u2019s a great impact sub but we\u2019re really missing Jones and Grav as subs especially because we play on Thursday. If we\u2019re playing Gomez as a 6 against City we will struggle, he\u2019s played it twice in his career against Southampton and Forest, teams where we will dominate possession.\nI\u2019m kind of expecting Gomez at RB against City tho, Bradley\u2019s been excellent but he\u2019s still really young and just starting his Liverpool career so I think Klopp will go for Gomez\u2019s experience", "If we don\u2019t beat Spurs at home after their fans were bantering us about that joke of a game I\u2019ll lose my mind", "yeah, absolutely, but they'll come to Anfield. only way for them to win is by horrible refs", "That\u2019s fair. We\u2019ve got them away in May still and it\u2019s not like I\u2019m not worried about it. But let\u2019s face it, it doesn\u2019t matter that Arsenal has been playing like the invincibles, I\u2019m worried about every match. Hope kills.", "Yeah I agree that both have merit as the best midfields out there right now. It\u2019s funny the similarities of importance that Partey and Rodri have for their respective teams. Not having Rodri on the field nowadays is a bordeline disaster for us right now. KDB is arguably the best player in the world on his day, but those days are less frequent than they used to be so maybe Ode is the crown prince!", "I\u2019m framing this.", "I didn\u2019t mean winning premier league.

Mentality only gets you so far or you wouldnt have the big spenders top of the league dominating.\n\nIf they play like they did in any of tat previous games, citeh beat them comfortably, mentality or not.", "Szoboszlai is not match fit enough to be in this conversation and we haven't seen enough of Darwin post his injury yet to assess whether he is too.

Endo is quite durable.", "Let's see how Arsenal do when they've got a tight schedule of fixtures for PL and CL in the next two weeks.", "This is true but I\u2019d still argue that City\u2019s remaining premier league schedule is harder. They have Liverpool, Arsenal, and Villa between now and April 3rd. They also play every other club currently in the top 10 before the end of the season (except United and Newcastle in the premier league). \n\nArsenal does still have to play City, Spurs, and Villa with tricky fixtures at United, Brighton and Chelsea. \n\nNot saying this automatically means Arsenal will have a better stretch but when you look at those fixtures and also the congestion of other competitions, I don\u2019t think strength of schedule is in City\u2019s favor.", "No, we need City to lose against us and Arsenal.", "Arsenal sub had loads of it. All the Arsenal fans I know in real life were saying it.", "Lmao you're chatting bullocks", "I can definitely see that happening too with how good Foden has been and with how KDB likes to operate in those spaces on the corner of the box. \n\nI think we\u2019re also forgetting Tsimikas as an attack-minded change also. His delivery is fantastic.", "By tricky i meant that Tottenham has players like Son , Maddison, etc who can do anything if it's their day... \n\nAnd i meant tricky for all 3 but i think both Arsenal & City go there while they come to Anfeild so it's a tiny bit of relief there", "Apart from maybe Leverkusen, you\u2019ve been the best team in the prem for sure and definitely been better than PSG, I\u2019d probably still back RM in a CL tie but you\u2019ve been better in the league.

Ake?", "Rodri was the best player in the world just last year, saying players like him are bang average is wild.", "Rodri plays basketball then?", "That's fair but people in this sub reddit talk about city like they're this completely unstoppable force who has no chance to lose, when they have their struggles just like every other top team.", "Foden plays on the right most times, and the match up with Robertson is more concerning for me than the one with Bradley.

Lost big names through the years. Players like G\u00fcndogan, San\u00e9, Silva were crazy for them.

I predict you will fall due to injuries because that's always been the case with Klopp's Liverpool, hasn't it.\n\nFwiw I feel the same about Liverpool in terms of the title, but there's this really annoying tendency among fans to downplay Arsenal for obscure and vague reasons. We're good on purpose, that should be obvious if you're paying attention.", "Nunes and kovacic might not move the needle but haaland definitely does. \n\nThey did lose some good players but to suggest they haven\u2019t gotten stronger is ludicrous.

You were making the point that City only just scraped past Bournmouth 1-0 last week as evidence they are fallible, my point was that they did exactly the same 5 years ago at the same point of the season and got to 98 points.

The fact they lost to Wolves in September doesn\u2019t tell us anything.", "Just how it happens every year you mean?", "It's not so much speedy players doing him, it's not reading a situation.

I\u2019ve no idea why Clattenberg comes out and says otherwise seeing as he has admitted to being biased before and favouring United back when he was a ref. Can\u2019t honestly take his word for granted, the man has zero credibility after admitting to breaking the rules before", "Look uh, it is ze best form of debate.", ">I\u2019ve not mentioned the game, I\u2019ve not mentioned the rules.\n\nThen there's nothing else to talk about or follow. MOVE ALONG\n\n>You follow a conversation just about as well as you follow a football team. When\u2019s the last time you went Anfield?\n\nDo you have anything else to say ? no ? Move along (2) \n\nI didn't want to waste my knowledge on trolls, but let me educate you a little bit : Liverpool is a global club like all other clubs in general and clubs like these are relevant in global picture and earn that much because of fans across the globe because we spend on jerseys , merchandise etc and without worldwide fans no-one will know a certain club from a certain area of a certain country. You are just lucky to be born in the country, and there's nothing to be proud of getting lucky. So I don't have to see my team at home to be a fan. Educated enough ?", "Get back to me when Arsenal can win an UCL", "So now your deflecting? You guys also deserved a red that game lmao", "And how much time could have been wasted on a corner at Liverpool's end if the ball had been given to the appropriate team?", "Firstly, I don\u2019t know what an ABL is, please enlighten me.\n\nSecondly, it\u2019s not a hypothetical because it literally happened and yet again you\u2019re missing the point. At that moment in time, the ref didn\u2019t see a foul and VAR didn\u2019t intervene, it wasn\u2019t given as a free kick so as far as the ref is concerned, he\u2019s only stopping play due to a head injury. In that circumstance the ball should go back to the team who had it when the whistle was blown. It\u2019s that simple, you talk about mental gymnastics yet you\u2019re the one talking about a foul that wasn\u2019t acknowledged or given, as some sort of justification for poor refereeing. \n\nIt\u2019s funny that you\u2019ll defend this but when you inevitably get fucked by a ref or VAR at some point, you\u2019ll call it out, but when it benefits you, you\u2019ll defend  it.", "No, all they did was quote what IFAB said, and they didn't actually apply it to the situation. The whistle is the start/end of a situation in a game. The ref stopped the game and therefore whatever happened between the head injury and him blowing the whistle simply does not matter. I don't know why people can't get their head around this.", "If you really don't know why Forest fans hate Liverpool so much then it just shows how myopic you all are. Always about you and you only.", "Singing songs about unemployment is worse? \n\nHave a long look at yourself", "We have a history for it\u2026.", "The difference between us is: I'll still support Arsenal regardless, you'll move on to the next big thing because you bleed plastic.", "How am I deflecting? I responded to your point with the correction. I don\u2019t remember any Liverpool player deserving a red that game, you haven\u2019t even said a name.\n\nAnd the richness of a Man City fan accusing us of being favoured when it has been blatant favouritism for Man City, the most corrupt club in the league.", "They didn\u2019t get a corner. Ifs and maybes to the point of fantasy. Poor Forest, could have had done even more time wasting with the drop ball \ud83d\ude02", "I'm sorry mate but I can't deal with this you're actually fucking stupid. \"If a tree falls in the woods and nobody is there, did it make a sound?\" Yes, a falling tree still makes a sound. Likewise a foul the referee didn't see is still a foul. If anybody is justifying poor refereeing it's you trying to use even worse refereeing.\n\nNobody is saying that the referee made the correct decision regarding the drop ball. What people are saying is that the referee's bad decision was cancelled out by him making the even worse error of not giving Yates a straight red. If the referee was competent the ball would have ended up in Liverpool's possession anyway. If anything Forest got off lucky from the shite ref because they should have been a man down.\n\nAlso don't call me a hypocrite when you and I both know that had the ball been given to Forest and no red card issued you would shrug your shoulders and say \"mistakes happen, get over it\".", "Hate us so much you sign loads of our ex players. Weirdos.", "What? Did we beat you one time? We don't give a fuck as though we're meant to remember every team that's been shagged", "Who said it was worse? Don't strawman me.", "Nearly half a century ago. Ancient history in football terms.", "OK astrologer\n\nFun fact : i started supporting Liverpool when they didn't win anything for years, but CRY louder", "How has it been favorited for city? Lmao we have had sooo many obvious decisions go against us. Like the Ruben Dias goal agaisnt Liverpool counting as a foul. The \u201coffiside\u201d call against Tottenham. The Rico Lewis goal vs Arsenal. The fact that hwang he Chan didn\u2019t get a red card after that tackle on Walker despite him having a yellow and 2 warnings. Also Cucerella not getting a second yellow for obvious simulation. And that\u2019s games where we did drop points that I would care to remember for. Our loss against Aston villa and draw agaisnt Chelsea (1-1)  and the draw vs crystal palace we were just shit. Now can you give me examples of city having the refs in favor of them?", "They didn't get a corner cause they weren't given the ball back.  The ball was supposed to go to Forest, simple as that, and Liverpool fans pointing to a supposed foul on Konate doesn't change those facts.", "Finally you\u2019re getting it. He made the incorrect decision to give Liverpool the drop ball. No matter how you frame it, at that point in play the ball should\u2019ve been given back to Forest. Him not awarding a free kick because he didn\u2019t see it is on VAR as they should\u2019ve alerted him to it but they didn\u2019t, so him giving the drop ball to Liverpool was incompetence.\n\nAnd again with the victim shit, when Liverpool got fucked over against spurs I was just as vocal about it, when Man City got fucked over against united for the Rashford offside that wasn\u2019t given I was just as vocal about it. I care about the officiating being correct because it ultimately affects us all.\n\nWe\u2019re gonna have to agree to disagree on this because neither of us are gonna change each other\u2019s mind, but if you want the last word, feel free.", "Clueless. Absolutely clueless.", "What even is that? Are you 15? You called our fans scum, considering your fans history, it\u2019s a tad over the top", "History is \u2026History, don\u2019t you get that?", "No you didn't. It's not fun or a fact, you're just a fairweather plastic.", "I will wait until you correct yourself on saying Liverpool get all the decisions, you have gone very quiet on that. Deflecting are we?!!!", "It was supposed to be a free kick to Liverpool but the ref played on. Everything else comes from that. And I know you\u2019ve seen it and know it was a foul. Having made one mistake, the ref made another technical one. None of it directly affected the outcome of the game, the response has been mental.", "Fuck off with this \"I just care about officiating being correct\" because it's evidently not true. If you actually cared you wouldn't be trying to defend bad officiating with more bad officiating. If the officiating is correct, then Liverpool still gets possession. You're so full of shit it's unreal. I don't believe you for a second, especially with all this \"finally, you get it\" lark like I hadn't been saying that the whole time.\n\nI never said that in a vacuum giving the drop ball to Liverpool was the correct decision, you're just so unbelievably fucking stupid you couldn't see past your obvious anti-Liverpool bias. Infact, I said the exact opposite to which you continued your mental gymnastics. You are right about opinions not being changed though, you're far too stubborn for that.", "If you don't understand the meaning of the word strawman then you're probably the one who is 15.", "Yes and there is a difference between recent and ancient. Get that?", "You asked me about city so sure let\u2019s go back to Liverpool. First off the game agaisnt city that goal should have stood. The Chelsea game you guys deserved to get a red(I\u2019ll go check who it was now so you don\u2019t deflect even more) there are way more but I don\u2019t remember them.", ">It was supposed to be a free kick to Liverpool\n\nThat is subjective as are most fouls.  It wasn't called, it's clear the ball should have been given back to Forest, and failing to do so changed the way the rest of the game was played.", "Still avoiding the real conversation I see\u2026", "Ancient History isn\u2019t History? \n\nI don\u2019t think you understand history", "No more than an incorrectly awarded free kick, corner kick or throw in.", "We've had the conversation, you asked me about Heysel and I answered you. What else is there to say?", "I don't think you get reading comprehension so we'll leave it at that.", "So, whose fans are the biggest scum? \n\nUs, who said some bad words, or you who were involved in a terrible football tragedy.", "Yeah, you lost that one. I\u2019ll take that 3pts", "You'd have to tell me if anyone who was involved at Heysel was in attendance at the match today. May surprise you to know that I don't have the answer to that.", "It you. You're the scum.", "You a Liverpool fan now?", "Every team has shit fans, before you abuse other teams fans, understand you own teams history.", "Cringe", "Here we go. Here's chief cunt making himself look silly with a last resort.", "Facts you mean?"]}}
